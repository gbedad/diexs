      <h3>About the characters</h3>
      <p>
        With half of the heroes from Avengers: Infinity War falling victim to
        Thanos’ snap, everyone is trying to work out how some if not all of our
        fallen heroes will return during the events of Avengers: Endgame.
        However, with movies, sequels and Disney+ TV shows already being
        announced, it is safe to say we know who will most likely survive the
        final confrontation with Thanos. Continue reading below for our list of
        characters who will most likely make it to Phase 4. Tom Holland’s Peter
        Parker has received nothing but positivity since his debut as the third
        portrayal of the web-slinger, including his death scene during Avengers:
        Infinity War being called one of the most tear-jerking moments with
        Holland’s reportedly improvised acting. Why his death is certainly not a
        permanent thing however, is that he is already set to star in the
        upcoming Spider-Man: Far From Home, slated for release in July 2019,
        which serves as both a sequel to 2017’s Spider-Man: Homecoming as well
        as the first movie in the MCU’s Phase 4 which has already been billed as
        dealing with the fallout of Avengers: Endgame.<br />
        Scarlet Witch and Vision are very much on a ratio 75/25 in terms of
        surviving or not. The reason for this is their upcoming Disney+ series
        WandaVision could very easily be a series set in a time already gone
        chronologically in the MCU, post-Civil War but pre-Infinity War.
        However, with both characters suffering different forms of death at the
        end of Infinity War with Vision having the Mind Stone ripped from his
        forehead by Thanos and Scarlet Witch being “dusted”, it remains to be
        seen just how our remaining Avengers find a way to bring both characters
        back.
