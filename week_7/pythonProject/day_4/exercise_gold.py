# Exercise 1 double dice

# Call it throw_dice. It should return an integer between 1 and 6.

# Create a function called throw_until_doubles.
# It should keep throwing 2 dice (using your throw_dice function) until they
# both land on the same number, ie. until we reach doubles.
# For example: (1, 2), (3, 1), (5,5) â†’ then stop throwing, because doubles were reached.
# This function should return the number of times it threw the
# dice in total. In the example above, it should return 3.

# It should throw doubles 100 times (ie. call your throw_until_doubles function 100 times),
# and store the results of those function calls (in other words, how many throws it took
# until doubles were thrown, each time) in a collection. (What kind of collection?
# Read below to understand what we will need the data for,
# and this should help you decide which data structure to use).
